Data Science and Economics are my passions. My name is Renato Vassallo, I am Peruvian, and I have been working in the quantitative field processing large amounts of data and evaluating traditional and more complex models for the last 6 years. I have held Economist positions in the government sector of Peru in the fields of Monetary and Fiscal policy. I transitioned into Data Science because Iâ€™m very passionate about learning new techniques and tools that can let me take substantial advantage of the large volume of information that is available today and thus enrich analytical models for a more efficient problem solving in almost every environment.
