Working with data from World Bank's Integrated Households Surveys (IHS), we undertake an analysis of Malawi's poverty and inequality indicators with the goal of aiding policymakers in the country design strategies to overcome the most critical challenges.

# Main findings

+ Poverty has remained intractable, despite some improvement. For example, since 2010 the percent of people living below the poverty line has fallen from 50% to 47%.

+ We show that the nature of poverty is different depending on the setting â€“ though poverty is less prevalent in urban areas, there is significantly greater inequality than in rural areas.

+ It is important to continue to promote economic growth in rural areas, as living in a rural area is still very highly correlated with poverty.

+ Need to address the heterogeneity between groups in the country, focus on factors driving poverty transitions, and improving access and quality of basic services.

# Poverty assessment

The following Table present three poverty indicators for Malawi in 2016 and 2019. For example, the incidence refers to the proportion of the population that lives below the poverty line, which decreased from 51.8% in 2016 to 47.2% in 2019.

When we examine the indicators separately for urban and rural areas, we find that poverty is higher in rural areas than in urban areas, both in 2016 and 2019. Also we found evidence that poverty is higher among households where the head has less than 6 years of education, compared to those with more than 6 years of education. However, the poverty incidence decreased for both education groups between 2016 and 2019.

# Inequality assessment

Looking at the next table, we can see that in 2016, Malawi had higher levels of inequality in urban areas than in rural areas, as evidenced by the much higher Theil index and Gini coefficient values for urban areas compared to rural areas. However, by 2019, both the Theil index and Gini coefficient had decreased for both urban and rural areas, indicating that inequality had decreased somewhat over time.

Despite the decrease in inequality over time, Malawi still experiences relatively high levels of
inequality, particularly in urban areas.

# Lorenz curves

In the next Figure we examine income inequality between the the urban and rural populations of Malawi across 2016 and 2019 through two Lorenz graphs. The 2016 graph shows a larger gap between the Rural and Urban curves and the Rural curve being situated to the left of the Urban curve, indicating a lower share of income or wealth for the rural population.

The 2019 graph shows a smaller gap between the curves, suggesting a decrease in income or wealth inequality, but the Rural curve still remains to the left of the Urban curve, indicating a lower inequality for the rural population.

The Lorenz graphs demonstrate that income or wealth disparities persist between the rural and urban populations of Malawi, with the urban population lagging behind in terms of inequality.
