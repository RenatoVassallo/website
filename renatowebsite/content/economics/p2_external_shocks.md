Given Pacific Alliance (PA) countries’ significant dependence on the external sector amidst volatile global financial conditions  and increased trade openness, it is important to understand the time-varying impact of external shocks on these economies to assess their resilience. We use data for 1994-2019 to study the heterogeneity of responses to financial, real, and nominal external shocks in PA countries over time.

# Highlights

+ Despite higher dependence on the external sector, PA economies countries remain stable.
+ We study the time-varying effects of external shocks on PA countries.
+ The impact of external shocks is magnified by expansionary global financial conditions.
+ Domestic interest rates respond more countercyclically to commodity price shocks.
+ Monetary policy has become more predictable.

+ We find that external shocks have played a significant role in domestic fluctuations, accounting for an average of 50% of fluctuations, with the impact becoming temporarily larger during the global low-interest-rate period; i.e., the impact of export price and Fed rate shocks on GDP increased the most, peaking in 2002-2011, whereas the effect of shocks originating in China, although the largest, remained stable.

+ In addition, monetary policy has become more predictable and countercyclical in response to commodity price shocks, contributing to PA countries' increased resilience to external shocks.

# Contributions to literature

1. First, we find evidence supporting the traditional view that external factors are the main source of macroeconomic fluctuations in EMEs (Calvo et al. (1993), Mendoza (1995)), in contrast with a body of research that maintains that the impact of external factors is overestimated.

2. Second, we estimate a family of VAR models that allow time variation of parameters, including the variance matrix. Time variation is needed to control for eventual non-linearities associated with structural economic changes and heteroscedastic shocks.

3. Finally, we jointly analyze the three transmission channels whereby shocks propagate into small open economies: (i) the trade channel; (ii) the financial channel; and (iii) the price channel.
