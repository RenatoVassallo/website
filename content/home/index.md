I am a data scientist and economist working at the intersection of AI and Economics.

My research interests lie in macroeconometrics, Bayesian methods, forecasting, and policy evaluation.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Economics, after earning two master’s degrees and publishing peer-reviewed papers and tutorials for the economics and data science community.
