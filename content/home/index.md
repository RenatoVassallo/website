I am passionate about applying machine learning and econometrics to understand complex social dynamics and improve policy decisions.

Before transitioning into data science, I worked as a macroeconomic specialist in Peru 🇵🇪, focusing on macro modeling, forecasting and scenario analysis — experience I continue to build on today as an external consultant.

My work bridges economics, statistical modeling, and AI — with a strong focus on making research reproducible, interpretable, and impactful. I'm also a strong advocate of open-source tools and active knowledge sharing.
