My research combines economics, econometrics, and machine learning to understand social phenomena, anticipate crises, and inform policy decisions. Recently, I have developed data-driven forecasting tools and applied causal methods in panel data to study economic dynamics in real-world settings.

Earlier, I worked as a macroeconomic specialist in Peru 🇵🇪, focusing on macro modeling, forecasting, and scenario analysis. I continue to collaborate on applied projects, which keeps my work grounded in practical policy questions.

I care about transparent and reproducible research and enjoy sharing tools and code whenever possible.
